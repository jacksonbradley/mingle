============================
I would prefer to have it with more of a beveled look for the buttons, like they are standing out. 
Also the center of the page should have a shadow so it looks like it is above the background, not just pasted on it. 
As for the background how about we do something similar to autodesk. Have the background be the entire image but in black/white mask. 
Then where the rotating images are, the mask is removed. As the images change the background changes as well. Check out http://www.autodesk.com/ for a better idea.
Sizing-wise that is actually pretty good.
I'm not sure of what you are talking about with the page shrinking... why is the page shrinking?
Where would you want animations? I do not like them personally, seem like too much of a gimmicky move.
When the person signs in it should just refresh the page they are on and make them signed in.
Ah. Sign In, should change to [username] and in the drop down have options to view/edit account as well as log out. 
As we see how the various projects turn out we can add features as necessary.
When you resize the window nothing should change. Stretching the page will only make things look bad. They'll just have to scroll or "ctrl -". 
I do not know what goes into making a mobile friendly site but I assume we'll need to recreate a version optimized for mobile devices. Which means another site???
Create acount should be under sign in
Under sign in there should be two headers. One aligned to the left and the other to the midline. 
The first will be Existing User and have the sign in boxes underneath, the next will be a Create Account with the ability to enter your name and 
email that will take you to a more complete page when you hit create.

Events
============================
Go through models and map out
Create a form derived from EventAddress Model
Use this form to validate posted data to /create
Enter in data
The view page takes in an event id
If event seen for first time, geocache and save lat/lon
